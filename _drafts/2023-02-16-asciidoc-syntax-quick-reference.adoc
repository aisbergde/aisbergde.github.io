Content between the end of the document header and the first section title in the document body is called the preamble. A preamble is optional.

Das ist eine Preamble. Sie kann wohl auch mehrere Absätze beinhalten.

Preamble kann vor dem TOC angezeigt werden, wenn `:toc: preamble` verwendet wird. Das wird aber wohl nicht von allen Renderern korrekt unterstützt

== Example 2. Literal paragraph

A normal paragraph.

 A literal paragraph.
 One or more consecutive lines indented by at least one space.

 The text is shown in a fixed-width (typically monospace) font.
 The lines are preformatted (i.e., as formatted in the source).
 Spaces and newlines,
 like the ones in this sentence,
 are preserved.

== Example 5. Constrained bold, italic, and monospace

It has *strong* significance to me.

I _cannot_ stress this enough.

Type `OK` to accept.

That *_really_* has to go.

Can't pick one? Let's use them `*_all_*`.

== Example 6. Unconstrained bold, italic, and monospace

**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete (CRUD)

That's fan__freakin__tastic!

Don't pass generic ``Object``s to methods that accept ``String``s!

It was Beatle**__mania__**!

== Example 7. Highlight, underline, strikethrough, and custom role

Werewolves are allergic to #cinnamon#.

##Mark##up refers to text that contains formatting ##mark##s.

Where did all the [.underline]#cores# go?

We need [.line-through]#ten# twenty VMs.

A [.myrole]#custom role# must be fulfilled by the theme.

== Example 8. Superscript and subscript

^super^script phrase

~sub~script phrase

== Example 9. Smart quotes and apostrophes

"`double curved quotes`"

'`single curved quotes`'

Olaf's desk was a mess.

A ``std::vector```'s size is the number of items it contains.

All of the werewolves`' desks were a mess.

Olaf had been with the company since the `'00s.

https://discuss.asciidoctor.org[Discuss Asciidoctor^]

== Example 12. URLs with spaces and special characters

link:++https://example.org/?q=[a b]++[URL with special characters]

https://example.org/?q=%5Ba%20b%5D[URL with special characters]

== Example 13. Link to relative file

link:index.html[Docs]

== Example 14. Link using a Windows UNC path

link:\\server\share\whitepaper.pdf[Whitepaper]

== Example 15. Inline anchors

[[bookmark-a]]Inline anchors make arbitrary content referenceable.

[#bookmark-b]#Inline anchors can be applied to a phrase like this one.#

anchor:bookmark-c[]Use a cross reference to link to this location.

[[bookmark-d,last paragraph]]The xreflabel attribute will be used as link text in the cross-reference link.

== Example 16. Cross references

See <<paragraphs>> to learn how to write paragraphs.

Learn how to organize the document into <<section-titles,sections>>.

== Example 17. Inter-document cross references

Refer to xref:document-b.adoc#section-b[Section B of Document B] for more information.

If you never return from xref:document-b.adoc[Document B], we'll send help.

== Example 24. Discrete heading (not a section)

== Example 37. Complex content in outline lists

* Every list item has at least one paragraph of content,
  which may be wrapped, even using a hanging indent.
+
Additional paragraphs or blocks are adjoined by putting
a list continuation on a line adjacent to both blocks.
+
list continuation:: a plus sign (`{plus}`) on a line by itself

* A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

 $ cd projects/my-book

* AsciiDoc lists may contain any complex content.
